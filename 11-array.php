<!-- Take a array, say for example this one: -->
<!-- a = [1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34, 55, 89] -->
<!-- and write a program that prints out all the elements of the list that are less than 5. -->


<!-- Take two lists, for example: -->
<!-- a = [1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34, 55, 89]

b = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13] -->

<!-- and write a program that returns a list that contains only the 
elements that are common between them (without duplicates). 
Make sure your program works on two lists of different sizes.
